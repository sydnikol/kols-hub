# Kol's Hub — Notion Relation Setup Guide

## 1. Importing the Master Table
1. In Notion, create a new database.
2. Use **Import → CSV** and select `Notion_Property_Template.csv`.
3. The icons and covers will auto‑populate using hosted URL placeholders.

## 2. Linking Category Tables
1. Create additional databases for each category (Health, Daily, etc.).
2. Add a **Relation** property named *Parent Feature* linking to your Master Table.
3. Optionally add a **Connected Page** property to link documents or handbooks.

## 3. Updating Icons & Covers
* Replace dummy PNGs inside `/Covers_Icons_Blend/` with your real artwork.
* Upload them to your hosting service (assets.kolhub.io or equivalent).
* Keep filenames identical (e.g., `KolHubAssets_Health_cover.png`).

## 4. Dashboard Setup
* Create a gallery view with covers visible at the top.
* Add a list view below for tasks and notes.
* Use dark‑mode for best readability with the Blend palette.

🖤 Enjoy your new Notion dashboard!
