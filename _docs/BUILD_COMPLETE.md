## ⚡ Performance Notes

All new pages load instantly because they use:
- Client-side routing (no page reloads)
- Lazy loading where appropriate
- Optimized animations
- Efficient state management

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Data Files** - Only sample data created, full datasets ready to import
2. **Placeholder Pages** - Need full implementation (structure in place)
3. **Offline Sync** - IndexedDB schemas not yet created
4. **Cross-Feature Search** - Not yet implemented

## 🎯 Recommended Next Steps

1. **Test the Mental Health page** - It's fully functional!
2. **Pick one feature to build next** - I recommend Learning Hub or Ideas Vault
3. **Import complete datasets** - All data is processed and ready
4. **Add more interactivity** - Favorites, bookmarks, export functions
